## Notes editor: indenting bullets

- **Tab** indents the bullet the caret is on by one level, together with its own nested bullets. The bullets
  after it stay where they are.
- **Shift+Tab** outdents a nested bullet by one level, together with its own nested bullets. The bullets that
  followed it keep their level, so they now sit under it. On a top-level bullet, Shift+Tab turns the line into
  plain text, as before.
- **With a selection**, Tab and Shift+Tab move exactly the bullets whose lines are selected, each one level.
  A bullet that cannot move (Tab on the first bullet of a list, Shift+Tab on a top-level bullet inside a mixed
  selection) stays where it is while the others move.
- Tab on a bullet that cannot be indented, such as the first bullet of a list, does nothing and keeps the caret
  in the editor.
